The code uses the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.

Making it work
--------------

You'll need to set up a dev environment as described in the
[Pebble SDK 2.0 docs](http://developer.getpebble.com/2/). Use the
[pebble tool](https://developer.getpebble.com/2/getting-started/pebble-tool/)
to build and install.

Bugs and issues
---------------

There are no known bugs, because I haven't figured out how to write unit tests
for Pebble projects.
